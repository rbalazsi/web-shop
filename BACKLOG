1. Document the APIs using Swagger

2. Implement customer-notification-service for demonstrating asynchronous processing
  - use Spring Cloud Stream with AMQP/RabbitMQ binder
  - send a notification email to the customer with the list of items he just ordered

3. Simulate real-world scenario
  - add 100 more products
  - implement paging of products
  - implement validation of customer email address
  - fix UI errors (null order, etc.)

4. Introduce JMeter for load testing
  - come up with ideas/strategies for test packs that reflect real-world scenarios (n search requests / sec, etc.)
  - implement test packs for them
  - demonstrate the scalability of the system, the advantage of load balancing, etc.

5. Containerize the services using Docker

6. Auto-scale the services with Marathon and Mesos
  - use JMeter to trigger scaling up automatically on high load, scaling down on lower load
